# 📈 Personal Long-Term Growth Plan

> **Core Strategy**: Fragmented Input + Concentrated Deliberate Practice

- [ ] **Listening Drill**
    - Intensive: **IELTS King Listening Corpus** (Dictation/Correction)
      - Only dictate words from Chapters 3, 4, & 5. Do not aim for 100% accuracy immediately; write one page daily. Ensure you can spell the word correctly upon hearing it.
    - Extensive: **Spotify Podcasts** (Commuting/Background noise, *All Ears English Podcast*)
    - *Suggestion: Recommended daily listening immersion > 30 mins.*
